## Introduction ü§ñ

The Elegoo Smart Car is an educational robot designed to teach robotics and programming concepts. This repository provides example code to help you understand how to control and program the Elegoo Smart Car for various tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, these examples will guide you through the process.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the Elegoo Smart Car and this example code, follow these steps:

1. **Acquire Hardware**: You'll need an Elegoo Smart Car kit and an Arduino-compatible microcontroller. Ensure that you have all the necessary components, including sensors, motors, and cables.

2. **Install Arduino IDE**: If you haven't already, install the Arduino IDE on your computer. You can download it from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Upload Example Code**: Open the Arduino IDE, select your board type, and upload the example code provided in this repository to your microcontroller. Each example comes with its own set of instructions.

4. **Connect Hardware**: Follow the wiring diagrams and instructions in the example code to connect your Elegoo Smart Car components to the microcontroller.

5. **Test and Learn**: Once the code is uploaded and your hardware is connected, test the functionality of the Smart Car. Observe how it behaves based on the code you've uploaded.

## Example Code üìù

### 1. [Basic_Movements](Basic_Movements)

- **Description**: This example code demonstrates basic movements of the Elegoo Smart Car, such as moving forward, backward, turning left, and turning right.

- **Usage**: Learn how to control the basic motion of the Smart Car.

### 2. [Obstacle_Avoidance](Obstacle_Avoidance)

- **Description**: The Smart Car drives forward until an obstacle is detected. It then looks around and turns towards the most open area to avoid obstacles.

- **Usage**: Understand how to implement obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.

### 3. [Line_Following](Line_Following)

- **Description**: This example teaches the Smart Car to follow lines on the ground using line tracking sensors. The car will autonomously follow a predefined path.

- **Usage**: Explore line following algorithms and sensors.

### 4. [RGB_LED_Control](RGB_LED_Control)

- **Description**: Control the RGB LED on the Elegoo Smart Car using Arduino. Change the LED color and brightness with this example.

- **Usage**: Learn how to manipulate RGB LEDs.

### 5. [Drive_with_DIY](Drive_with_DIY)

- **Description**: Demonstrates driving the Smart Car using a custom communication system via a DIY screen.

- **Usage**: Implement your custom control system for the Smart Car.

### 6. [Ultrasonic_Measurement](Ultrasonic_Measurement)

- **Description**: Measure distances using the ultrasonic sensor on the Smart Car and display the results on the serial monitor.

- **Usage**: Understand how to work with ultrasonic sensors.

## Additional Features ‚öôÔ∏è

In addition to the example code, you can further extend the capabilities of the Elegoo Smart Car by implementing the following features:

- **Custom Commands**: Create custom commands to control the Smart Car's actions and behavior.

- **PID Control**: Implement a PID control algorithm for smoother line following and precise motion control.

- **USB Communication**: Develop programs that allow users to send commands to the Smart Car via USB communication for real-time control.
